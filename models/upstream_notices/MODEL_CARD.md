# Model card: MDV6-yolov10-c

This package retains the supplied runtime bytes under the recorded upstream terms. Sparrow did not train or reconvert those bytes in this remediation.

Frozen audit records (historical evidence, not a new grant or conversion run):

- Recorded weight terms: AGPL-3.0
- Terms/conflicts: CITATION REPAIRED IN ROUND 3, on subarea-camera-trap-detectors-r3's finding. My first pass auto-derived this row's source URL from the catalog reference field and landed on doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15398270 - a record whose metadata declares cc-by-4.0, i.e. a source that does not state the grant recorded here. That is the same 'cited source does not publish the claim' defect I enforced on contact rows and had not enforced on rights rows. The source that DOES state it, which the peer supplied and I verified, is microsoft/MegaDetector README l.423: 'The MegaDetector CODE in this repository is released under the MIT License. The MODEL WEIGHTS carry per-variant licenses, MIT, Apache-2.0, or AGPL-3.0 depending on the variant, so check the license of the specific model you deploy.' That sentence is first-party and expressly WEIGHTS-SCOPED, which is exactly what PASS-OPEN-SOURCE requires and what the peer's own suggested citation supplies. UNRESOLVED CONFLICT CARRIED: the rights holder's own client code fetches all nine variants from Zenodo 15398270, whose record-level field says cc-by-4.0. I read the per-variant weights-scoped statement as governing because that record is disproved as a per-file grant - it and 13357337 both blanket-license ULiege HerdNet checkpoints their depositor cannot relicense - but the conflict is real and a promotion consumer must see it.

## Recorded model scope

- Domain/task/format: camera_trap / detector / onnx
- Architecture/family (catalog, not inferred): ["MegaDetector"]
- Geographic scope (catalog): global
- Regions (catalog): []
- Intended use (catalog): not separately recorded; consult upstream

Dataset/use constraints recorded by the frozen audit:

No dataset-level restriction separate from the weight grant was located. The weight grant is the operative constraint.

No new accuracy, dataset clearance, or fitness claim is made by this packaging pass.

## TensorRT first-build setting

Model bytes are unchanged. This package deliberately sets
`[inference.trt].builder_optimization_level = 2` to restore bounded first-build
time on the measured reference host, trading some maximum TensorRT
optimization for build time. Real inference validation and the 300-second
warm-up deadline remain required; the engine-wide builder default stays 3.
This is a model-specific tradeoff, not a guarantee for other hardware or models.
